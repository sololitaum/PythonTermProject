# Cats vs Dogs Classifier

A deep learning image classifier that distinguishes between cats and dogs using TensorFlow and MobileNetV2. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction visualization.

# Contributors
## Solomiya Pylypiv
Built and trained the model in cats_vs_dogs_classifier.py
### Commits
- initial commit to create the repo
- main.py which trains a deep learning model using the MobileNetV2 to classify images of cats and dogs from a TensorFlow dataset then visualizes the training results and saves the trained model
- eval

## Joey Brinker
Created the prediction and visualization script in predict_image.py
### Commits
- Predict Image: These commits were my addition of the predict_image.py file. The first commit of this name is the actual prediction functionality. The second commit of this name was when I added a visual representation of what the model predicts using a pie chart from matplot lib.
